# World-Happiness-Report-2021

Exploratory Data Analysis Project

ðŸ“Œ After collecting and storing data, I will need to conduct an analysis of all the variables in your data frame.I need to observe how each variable is  distributed, and understand their relationship with each other. We must also be able to answer questions with the help of data available.
ðŸ“Œ The World Happiness Report tracks six factors to measure global happiness â€” life expectancy, economics, social support, absence of corruption, freedom, and generosity.
ðŸ“Œ The World Happiness Report tracks six factors to measure global happiness â€” life expectancy, economics, social support, absence of corruption, freedom, and generosity.

   This is a project that will help improve my skillset as an analyst. A trait Iâ€™ve seen in most successful data analysts is curiosity.
   Data scientists and analysts are always looking for contributing factors.
   If we are an aspiring data scientist, doing projects like this will help our develop an analytical mind.
